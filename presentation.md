# Jetpack Compose

---

> Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit designed to simplify UI development
-- Compose Codelab

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Promises

- Declarative UI
- Rethinking the legacy
- Independent from Android Version
- Compatible with Views

---

# Compose in a nutshell

1. Throw away layouts 
1. Throw away resource files
1. Do everything in code.

---

# Hello world

```kotlin
// Old way
val textView = TextView(this)
textView.setText("Hello world")
setContentView(textView)
```

```kotlin
// New way
setContent { Text("Hello World") }
```

# Why is it called Compose?

- Function calls a function
- One element composes others

# A typical screen

    is Success -> EventDetails(state.event)
  }
}
```

^ Every time we want to update a screen, we should call this function

---

Where is my Event?

---

~~Where is my Event?~~
Where is my State?

---

# MVP

```kotlin
intervace View {
    fun showLoader()
    fun hideLoader()
    fun showError(msg: String)
    fun hideError()
    fun showContent(events: List<Event>)
}
```

---

# MVVM

Looks better:
```kotlin
class View {
  init {
    loaderStream.observe { handleLoader(it) }
    errorStream.observe { handleError(it) }
    contentStream.observe { handleContent(it) }
  }
}
```

^ That's actually closer, as we can subscribe Compose to these streams
---

# MVI

```kotlin
class View {
  init {
    uiStateSteam.observe { renderUi(it) }
  }
}
```

---
[.code-highlight: 1, 5]

# MVI

}
```

> Model is responsible for representing state, structure, and behaviour of the userâ€™s mental model.

---

> A View presents information that it retrieves from one or more model objects.

---

> Let the View register with the Model as being a dependent of the Model, and let the Model send appropriate messages to its dependents whenever it changes. 
-- Trygve Reenskaug in 1979 as a part of MVC architecture.

^ Loosely speaking, the original explanation specifies Model as an entity which tells View what to display on the screen. If Model changes, View gets notified about the change, and it will render the change on the screen.

---
# MVI

![original 140%](images/MVI.png)

---

1. Model (State)
1. View (View)
1. Intent (Action)

^ That's came from Redux

---

 [Three details screens here: loading, error, details]

---
// TODO: scheme of how is it changes
// changed the field, it went to model, etc
// on EventsDetail screen

```kotlin
sealed class ScreenState<out T> {
  class Loading<out T> : ScreenState<T>()
  data class Error(val error: String) : ScreenState<Nothing>()
  class Success<out T>(val data: T) : ScreenState<T>()
}
```

---

```kotlin
data class DetailsState (
  val details: Event,
  val isLoading: Boolean,
  val errorMessage: String?
)
```

 [Image : there are details, but also Swipe Layout loader]

---

# ViewIntent

```kotlin
sealed class DetailsViewIntent {
  data class SetEvent(val id: String)
  object Refresh : DetailsViewIntent()
}
```

---

# A problem of state

Views with intrinsic state:
`SwipeRefreshLayout`
`Spinner`
`EditText`

[SwipeRefreshLayout and EditText pictures on the right]

---

# EditText with PhoneWatcher

```kotlin
phoneView.addTextChangedListener(phoneFormatter)
phoneView.addTextChangedListener(viewIntentSender)
// ...
fun update(vm : viewStateModel) {
  phoneView.setText(vm.phone)
}
```

^ selection will go nuts + text will become unformatted + infinite loop

---

# EditText in Compose

// TODO: check if we need to use mutableState inside
// and not immutable state

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhoneTextField() {
  val state = state { TextFieldValue("") }
  TextField(
           value = state.value,
           onValueChange = { state.value = it }
  )
}
```

---

# EditText in Compose

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhoneTextField(val text : String, 
                   val inputListener : Listener ) {
  TextField(
           value = text,
           onValueChange = { listener.textUpdated(it) }
  )
}
```

---

# Recomposing

// TODO: highlith adapter line

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhoneTextField(val textStream : LiveData<String>, 
                   val inputListener : Listener ) {
  val state = stateOf { textStream.asState }
  TextField(
           value = text,
           onValueChange = { listener.textUpdated(it) }
  )
}
```
There are adapters for:
LiveData, ObservableSource, Flow

# What's next?

1. Architecture
1. Navigation
1. DI

^Parts of a prod app

---

# Architecture

No restrictions:

1. Mutliple Activities
1. Multiple Fragments
1. Compose - only

---

# Navigation

No restrictions:

1. Jetpack Navigation - in progress
1. Custom routers (example in JetNews)

---

# To conclude

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Pros 

1. Code-first approach
1. Code coherence
1. Code navigation
1. Independence from Android Updates
1. Simpler RecyclerViews

^ 1. With Compose, your UI is defined as a function, and this function transforms data into View Hierarchy. As a result, we don't need to separate View initialization and its further update - it's in the same place. Add image of a 3-button-button
^ 4. We can literally create everything in code... conveniently. Get rid of millions of shapes with different colors or different corners

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Cons

1. Learning curve
2. Readability
3. Need to mature

^ I know many devs who are ok with the way things already work

--- 
# Plans 

1. Biweekly releases
2. Alpha is something that we can play with in our apps
3. Release the 1.0 in 2021
4. Definitely early to use in prod, good to use in side projects, if ok with refactoring it later
