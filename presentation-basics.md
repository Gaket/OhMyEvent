# Compose in a nutshell

1. Throw away layouts 
1. Throw away resource files
1. Do everything in code

# Hello world

```kotlin
// Old way
val textView = TextView(this)
textView.setText("Hello world")
setContentView(textView)
```

```kotlin
// New way
setContent { Text("Hello World") }
```

![fit right](images/helloworld.png)

---
# Functions?

```kotlin
// New way
setContent { Text("Hello World") }
```

^Do you remember what do the curly brackets mean? That's a function

---

# Why is it called Compose?

- Function calls a function
- One element composes others

# MVP

```kotlin
intervace View {

    fun hideLoader()
    fun showError(msg: String)
    fun hideError()
    fun showContent(events: List<Event>)

# MVVM

Looks better:

```kotlin
class View {
  init {
    loaderStream.observe { handleLoader(it) }
    errorStream.observe { handleError(it) }
    contentStream.observe { handleContent(it) }
  }
}
```

^ That's actually closer, as we can subscribe Compose to these streams

#[fit] Model View Intent

---

> Model is responsible for representing state, structure, and behaviour of the userâ€™s mental model.

---

> A View presents information that it retrieves from one or more model objects.
>-- Trygve Reenskaug in 1979 as a part of MVC architecture.

^ Loosely speaking, the original explanation specifies Model as an entity which tells View what to display on the screen. If Model changes, View gets notified about the change, and it will render the change on the screen.

# What's next?

1. Architecture
1. Navigation
1. DI

^Parts of a prod app

---

# Architecture

No restrictions:

1. Mutliple Activities
1. Multiple Fragments
1. Compose - only

^ Do you remember how apps architecture changed when Android Views system came?

---

# Navigation

No restrictions:

1. Jetpack Navigation - in progress
1. Custom routers (example in JetNews)

---

#[fit] To conclude

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Pros 

1. Code-first approach
1. Code coherence
1. Code navigation
1. Independence from Android Updates
1. Simpler RecyclerViews

^ 1. With Compose, your UI is defined as a function, and this function transforms data into View Hierarchy. As a result, we don't need to separate View initialization and its further update - it's in the same place. Add image of a 3-button-button
^ 4. We can literally create everything in code... conveniently. Get rid of millions of shapes with different colors or different corners

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Cons

1. Learning curve
2. Readability
3. Need to mature
4. Navigation without classes ðŸ˜±

^ I know many devs who are ok with the way things already work

--- 

# Jetpack Compose Plans 

1. Biweekly releases
2. Alpha is something that we can play with in our apps
3. Release the 1.0 in 2021
4. Definitely early to use in prod, good to use in side projects, if ok with refactoring it later
